# Adult Dataset Analysis

**Project Description:**

The repository's aim is to provide a Machine Learning analysis of the "Adult Dataset" which contains information about some social and economical features of the american workers during the '90s. The target variable (which means: the phenomenon that's going to be studied) measure the belonging to the social class with an annual income higher or lower than 50K.

_First Notebook:_

To start, an Exploratory Data Analysis is necessary to process data before apply them the Machine Learning algorithms. In this section there's the enconding, scaling, imputing and general managing of the observations collected in the Dataset.

_Second Notebook:_

After the pre-processing of data, the analysis is focused on find a proper Classification Model (Logistic Regression) to understand both which predictors are the most significant for the phenomenon studied and to predict well when someone belongs to one of the two categories. The models are estimated by using the object of the Python library "sklearn" and they are evalueted through the compute of the following metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, f1.

_Third Notebook:_

In order to boost the classification's performance and to try other models, in this section the same goals of the "Second Notebook" are reached through the use of Decision Trees and Random Forests.
